Problem Statement #6:Game List application [Frontend]

Installation steps for react:
1)npm i
2)npm start

Create a folder src which has sub folders module which has Gamespage and login and app files

Initially App.js-component-rendered
Here Since routing and State management is not used the entire application is handled via Components and conditional rendering 

Application Flow for Frontend alone:

1)Login-handled via 2 states setRegister and SetGames
Once Login they can go to games and else the other option is the user can register if new user
